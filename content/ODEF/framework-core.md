## Framework Core

The Framework Core delineates a suite of activities designed to accomplish specific cybersecurity objectives, supplemented by illustrative examples to guide their implementation.

### Functions, Goals, Guidelines

There are set of functions, goals and guidelines for each **phase** from the detection lifecycle. Functions, goals, guidelines help the detection engineer to have north star focus and deliver a detection with exceptional quality.

#### **Functions**

Similarly to python functions those are single goal activities that return or drive particular outcome. {{Example}}

#### **Goals**

Every function aims to deliver defined and desired result. Though goals may be high-level and occasionally abstract, establishing a direct correlation between *functions* and *goals* is strongly recommended.

#### **Guideline**

Guidelines serve as adaptable reference materials aiding in the attainment of goals within any given function. For instance, a document detailing a company's unique Change Management process would qualify as a *guideline*.

### Phases

The Core encompasses three primary lifecycle phases:

* **[Sunrise]({{< ref "Sunrise" >}})**
* **[Midday]({{< ref "Midday" >}})**
* **[Sunset]({{< ref "Sunset" >}})**

These phases collectively chronicle the lifespan of a detection mechanism, from its conception to its eventual retirement/decommissioning.
