## Framework Core

The Framework Core provides a set of activities to achieve specific cybersecurity outcomes and references examples of how to achieve those outcomes. 

### Functions, Goals, Guidelines

There are set of functions, goals and guidelines for each **phase** from the detection lifecycle. Functions, goals, guidelines help the detection engineer to have north star focus and deliver a detection with exceptional quality.

#### **Functions**

Similarly to python functions those are single goal activities that return or drive particular outcome. {{Example}}

#### **Goals**

Each function aims to deliver defined and desired result. Although goals are high level and could be abstract it recommended to a clearly defined one-to-one relationship between *functions* and *goals*.

#### **Guideline**

Guidelines are flexible documents that support achieving set goal in a particular function. Example: Each company can have their own Change Management processes and any document describing the process can be considered *guideline*.

### Phases

The Core comprises of three lifecycle phases:

* **[Sunrise]({{< ref "Sunrise" >}})**
* **[Midday]({{< ref "Midday" >}})**
* **[Sunset]({{< ref "Sunset" >}})**

These phases describe the complete life of a detection - from inception to decommissioning.
