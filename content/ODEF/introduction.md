## Purpose

ODEF enables organization to establish and apply fundamental principles and best practices in detection engineering.
Adopting ODEF catalyzes service enhancement, process refinement, and maturity in cybersecurity practices.

The framework is strategically oriented around leveraging business objectives to steer cybersecurity efforts. It enables the creation of robust detection systems, enhances visibility, reduces reliance on vendors, and, most importantly, strengthens an organization's overall security stance. ODEF not only articulates the principles for proficient detection engineering but also introduces a three-tiered maturity model for assessing organizational performance.

Each phase within the framework's core is meticulously designed to outline the detection lifecycle, directing the detection engineer's efforts with focused phase functions and steering them through the entire process.
The maturity levels serve as benchmarks, offering organizations a macroscopic view of their detection engineering strategy and pinpointing potential areas for enhancement.

## High-Level Goals

The overarching ambitions of the framework are to:

* Establish a methodical, replicable, and predictable approach for developing hunts and detections.
* Achieve extensive organizational visibility.
* Transform insights into sustainable, actionable knowledge while fostering a culture of information sharing.
* Promote persistent vigilance in detection practices.
* Validate detections rigorously through systematic testing.
* Cultivate an environment where knowledge is the main driver of security initiatives.
