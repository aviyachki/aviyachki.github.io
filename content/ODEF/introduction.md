## Purpose

ODEF enables organization to create and apply principles and best practices for detection engineering.
Utilizing it leads to service and process improvements and maturity.

The Framework focuses on using business goals and outcomes to drive and guide cybersecurity activities to deliver detections, improve visibility, minimize vendor dependencies and ultimately improve the organization security posture. The Framework provides the principles that guide efficient and effective detection engineering practices and also provides three maturity levels to measure the organization performance.

Each phase of the frameworkâ€™s core aims to describe the detection lifecycle and uses phase functions to focus the effort of the detection engineer and guide them through the process.
The three maturity levels provide a high level mechanism for organizations to view and evaluate their approach to detection engineering and focus on areas of improvement.

## High level goals

The framework high level goals are to:

* Provide guidance on how to be systematic, repeatable and predictable when building hunts and detections
* Ensure that high visibility is achieved throughout the organization
* Convert insights to retainable and actionable Knowledge and promote knowledge sharing
* Introduce continuous vigilance
* Introduce detection validation through testing
* Facilitate a knowledge driven environment
