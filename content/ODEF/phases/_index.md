## Intro

**ODEF** pioneers the concept of a *detection lifecycle*, comprehensively encapsulating the journey of a detection mechanism from creation to retirement. It's structured into three distinct phases: **Sunrise**, **Midday**, and **Sunset**. This tri-phase approach ensures thorough coverage for each stage of a detection's active life. Corresponding to each phase are specific functions, goals, and guidelines that lay the groundwork for effective and efficient detection engineering.
